<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<h4>
  What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure
  did you choose to implement?
</h4>

<p>
  My website is a book club platform that aims to attract book enthusiasts to
  join the club and participate in its events. The essential story being told by
  the site is one of a community of like-minded individuals who are passionate
  about reading and want to connect with others who share the same interests.
  <br /><br />To achieve this, the site has been structured in a way that is
  user-friendly and easy to navigate. The homepage provides an overview of the
  book club, its mission and values, and the benefits of joining. The site
  offers a variety of resources for book recommendations, categorized by genres,
  to help users find a book they will enjoy. <br /><br />Existing members can
  check in for events and other updates while new visitors can browse the site
  and decide if they want to join. The site is designed to encourage visitors to
  sign up, participate in discussions and events, and ultimately become members
  of the book club.<br /><br />In summary, the website is designed to be a
  welcoming and engaging platform for book lovers to connect and share their
  passion for literature.<br /><br />

<h3>Inspiration:</h3>
<h4>
  State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest
  speakers, websites, artists, blogs).
</h4>
<p>
  1. The Netflix book club site [1] <br /><br />2. Book Clubs website [2]
  <br /><br />3. Good Reads website [3]<br /><br />
</p>

<h3>Accessibility:</h3>
<h4>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h4>
<p>
  My website is designed with accessibility in mind and offers multiple features
  to ensure that it is accessible to a wide range of users, including those with
  disabilities. Here are three ways in which the site is accessible:
  <br /><br />
  1. Keyboard Navigation: The website is built with keyboard-only navigation in
  mind. This means that users with physical disabilities who are unable to use a
  mouse can still navigate through the site using only their keyboard.<br /><br />2.
  Alternative Text: All images on the site have descriptive alternative text
  that explains what the image is showing. This is particularly useful for
  visually impaired users or those using a screen reader.<br /><br />3. Color
  Contrast: The site uses a combination of warm and cool colors with high
  contrast between text and background. This makes the site easier to read for
  users with color blindness or low vision.<br /><br />In summary, the website
  is designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their
  abilities. By incorporating these features, we strive to provide an inclusive
  and user-friendly experience for everyone who visits our site.<br /><br />
</p>

<h3>Usability:</h3>
<h4>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</h4>
<p>
  Ensuring the usability of my site has been a top priority in the design
  process. Here are three ways in which I have considered usability:<br /><br />
  1. Intuitive Navigation: The site features an easy-to-use navigation system
  that is always accessible to users. The navigation bar is fixed at the top of
  the site, while the footer is fixed at the bottom, allowing users to quickly
  find the content and pages they are looking for.
  <br /><br />
  2. Responsive Design: The site is optimized for use on all devices, including
  computers, tablets, and smartphones. This ensures that users can access the
  site from any device and that the site functions properly regardless of the
  screen size.<br /><br />3. Clear Calls-to-Action: The website features clear
  calls-to-action that guide users to take specific actions, such as signing up
  for the book club. The buttons for the calls-to-action are strategically
  placed to lead users to different parts of the site and encourage them to
  engage with the content.<br /><br />In summary, usability is a critical aspect
  of website design, and I have taken great care to ensure that my site is
  intuitive, responsive, and easy to navigate. By incorporating these features,
  I aim to provide a seamless and engaging user experience that encourages
  visitors to explore the site and join the book club.<br /><br />

<h3>Learning:</h3>
<h4>
  State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you
  achieve that?
</h4>
<p>
  Creating a website can be a challenging process that requires learning new
  skills and techniques. Here are three things that I had to learn or find out
  to create my site, and how I achieved that: <br /><br />
  1. Creating an infinitely moving carousel: To achieve this effect on my top
  picks page, I had to learn how to use HTML and CSS to create a carousel that
  would pause on mouse hover. I found online resources that explained the
  necessary code and then modified it to fit my design and presentation.<br /><br />
  2. Form validation: On the join us page, I needed to create a form that could
  be validated to ensure that only valid input was accepted for registration. To
  achieve this, I customized the bootstrap code and added JavaScript validation
  to the form. <br /><br />
  3. Implementing a back to top button: To enhance user experience on every
  page, I implemented a back-to-top button that appears when the user scrolls
  down. This was achieved using JavaScript to interact with the DOM. This button
  allows the user to move up the page with just the click of the button rather
  than scrolling up endlessly.<br /><br />
  In summary, creating a website requires continuous learning and
  problem-solving. By leveraging online resources, customizing existing code,
  and incorporating new techniques, I was able to create a website that meets my
  design and functionality goals.<br /><br />

<h3>Evaluation I:</h3>
<h4>
  What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?
</h4>
<p>
  Reflecting on my work, I believe that several aspects were particularly
  successful:<br /><br />
  1. Appealing Appearance and Color Palette: The pages of my website have an
  attractive appearance, thanks to the contrasting colors that work well
  together. Although I initially had some doubts about the combination, I took
  the risk and it paid off.<br /><br />
  2. Image Carousels: The image carousels implemented on the events page and top
  picks page were successful. I utilized online resources and made some
  modifications to create an engaging and user-friendly experience for
  visitors.<br /><br />
  3. Form Validation: The join us page's form validation was a key success. By
  implementing JavaScript validation, I was able to ensure that only valid
  inputs were accepted, enhancing the user experience and allowing for proper
  submission of information.<br /><br />
  Overall, I am pleased with the final result of my website. The successful
  aspects mentioned above contributed to creating an attractive, user-friendly,
  and functional site that meets the needs of book lovers who are interested in
  joining the book club.<br /><br />
</p>

<h3>Evaluation II:</h3>
<h4>
  What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things
  differently another time?
</h4>
<p>
  Upon reflection, I recognize that there are a few aspects of my work that
  could be improved:<br /><br />
  1. Lack of Content and Pages: While my website provides basic information
  about the book club, it could benefit from additional content and pages that
  would allow users to explore more. For example, I could add testimonials from
  current members to create a more personal connection with potential
  members.<br /><br />
  2. Limited Responsiveness: Although the site is responsive, the content
  changes font size but the positions remain the same. To improve this, I could
  consider implementing collapsible content, allowing users to focus on specific
  information while maintaining a clean and organized layout.<br /><br />
  3. Optimization: I could have spent more time optimizing the site for faster
  loading times, which would enhance the user experience.<br /><br />
  If I were to do things differently next time, I would ensure that the site has
  more content and pages to offer, improve responsiveness and optimize the site
  for faster loading times. Additionally, I would conduct user testing to gather
  feedback and identify areas for improvement throughout the development
  process.<br /><br />
